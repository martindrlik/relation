# rex

Experimental relational NoSQL database. Mainly touching upon the incomplete data problem. It is my playground for ideas and API will change over time. There is a lot more to do before it can be even considered interesting.

## Program usage
```
Usage:
	rex <command> <input> <options> [attribute ...]
Commands:
	difference
	natural-join
	union
Input:
	-fa <file>   [-ta <file>   ...]: name of file that contains array of tuples
	-ia <inline> [-ia <inline> ...]: inline array of tuples
Options:
	-of <format>: output format: table or json
Note:
	JSON is used as an input format
```

## Examples
```
